This is one of three \'groups\' that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \'flit\' is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \'fits\', each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \'speed\' (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \'transfers\' here refer to \'fits\'.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \'flit\' at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \'data\' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \'data\' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \'data\' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.; Counts the total number of protocol flits transmitted over QPI on the DRS (Data Response) channel.  DRS flits are used to transmit data with coherency.  This does not count data flits transmitted over the NCB channel which transmits non-coherent data.

This is one of three \'groups\' that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.

In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \'fits\', each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.

One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \'data\' bandwidth.

In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \'speed\' (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \'transfers\' here refer to \'fits\'.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \'flit\' at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \'data\' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \'data\' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \'data\' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.; Counts the total number of flits transmitted over the NDR (Non-Data Response) channel.

One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \'data\' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \'data\' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \'data\' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.; Counts the number of data request received over QPI on the home channel.  This basically counts the number of remote memory requests received over QPI.  In conjunction with the local read count in the Home Agent, one can calculate the number of LLC Misses."), counter: Counter::Programmable(15), counter_ht_off: Counter::Fixed(0), pebs_counters: None, sample_after_value: 0, msr_index: MSRIndex::None, msr_value: 0, taken_alone: false, counter_mask: 0, invert: false, any_thread: false, edge_detect: false, pebs: PebsType::Regular, precise_store: false, data_la: false, l1_hit_indication: false, errata: None, offcore: false, unit: Some("QPI LL"), filter: None, extsel: true }),

                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
