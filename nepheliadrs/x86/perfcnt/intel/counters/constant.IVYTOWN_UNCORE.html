In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \'fits\', each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \'speed\' (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \'transfers\' here refer to \'fits\'.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \'flit\' at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \'data\' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \'data\' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \'data\' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.; Number of Non-Coherent Bypass non-data flits.  These packets are generally used to transmit non-coherent data across QPI, and the flits counted here are for headers and other non-data flits.

                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
                    <code>fn:</code>) to restrict the search to a given type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accepted types are: <code>fn</code>, <code>mod</code>,
                    <code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>,
                    <code>trait</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>macro</code>,
                    and <code>const</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Search functions by type signature (e.g.
                    <code>vec -> usize</code>)
